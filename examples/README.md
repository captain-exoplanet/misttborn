CONTENTS:
- K2-260: files to reproduce the analysis of the hot Jupiter K2-260 b from [Johnson et al. (2018)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481..596J). This example shows how to simultaenously fit photometric and radial velocity data, including multi-band photometry from multiple instruments and radial velocity jitter. To run this example, download the files and call the code as:
```
python misttborn.py K2-260.inpm -p -r -v
```
